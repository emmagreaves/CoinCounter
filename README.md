# CoinCounter

This is my first project on GitHub. It's a nifty coin counter I built as a part of a problem set in ES50 for the elementary image processing unit.

I think it's neat, so I'm putting it here. It processes the image (and displays a figure of the processed image) and uses the areas of the dark portions of each processed image and thresholds that correspond to each coin type to identify how much change we have. 

It's not perfect. Right now, we can only count nickels, dimes, and quarters. I hope to expand our capabilities here, but who cared about pennies anyways?

I'd also like to experiment with these techniques beyond coin counting. A cool project would be to build a chess coach--snap a pic while your opponent isn't looking, and receive feedback to guide you in making your best move.

The opportunities are endless!
